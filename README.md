# Portfolio Website - Kamaljot Wilkhoo

Welcome to my portfolio website repository!

## Viewing the Website Locally

This website uses JavaScript to dynamically load the header, footer, and blog posts.  
To properly view all features, **do not just open the HTML files directly** in your browser.

Instead, serve the site using a local web server. If you have Python installed, you can do this easily:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the root folder of this repository (where the HTML files are).
3. Run the following command:

```bash
python3 -m http.server
